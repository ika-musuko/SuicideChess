PART 1: SETTING UP DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

1. Install git-bash: https://git-scm.com/download/win
	On the "Choosing the default editor" page of the installer choose whatever you'd like (I just use Vim, the default one)
	On the "Adjusting your PATH environment" page choose the "Use Git from Git Bash only" option
2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win
3. Install node.js :https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.9.4/node-v8.9.4-x64.msi
4. Open Git Bash (You can just search for it)
5. Go to GitHub, make sure you're signed in and then go to your account settings
6. On the left click SSH and GPG keys
7. Click New SSH Key in the top right corner
8. Put whatever you like in the title.
9. Now go back to git bash and type these commands (If you want to copy and paste ctrl+c and the right click in the git bash and select paste) and press enter after:
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
	press enter once prompted to enter a file
	Enter a password or just press enter to leave it blank if you want (note: when you type nothing will show up, don't worry about this it's still typing you just can't see it)
	Repeat the password
	eval $(ssh-agent -s)
	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
10. Your SSH key is now added to your computer, now we need to add it to your github account, back in the bash type this command and press enter:
	clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
11. Now your key should be copied, go back to github and paste it into the ssh key box and click add

PART 2: SETTING UP REACT ENVIRONMENT

1. Open up git bash, you should be in your home directory
2. type command and press enter: 
	cd Documents
	git clone git@github.com:Diskiddin/Suicide-Chess.git
	cd Suicide-Chess
3. You now should have the files downloaded
4. Cd into the project folder(yes this is repeated)
	cd suicide-chess
5. Run commands (this first one will take a while):
	npm install
	npm start
6. You should be all set up here, if you have any questions just ask me
