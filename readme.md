## Build Instructions
**Note:** These instructions only work for Linux or Mac (or anything that can interpret .sh files). Good luck if you have Micro$oft Window$!

### Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- node.js v8

Make sure you can run `node` and `npm` from the terminal.

### Setting up your Environment

1. Create a Python Virtual Environment somewhere. We will refer to the path as `$VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH`. (Please do not make this path inside the same directory as the project).   
`python3.6 -m virtualenv $VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH`
    - Note: If this command does not work, try running `python3.6 -m pip install virtualenv` first.
2. Go into the virtual environment.  
`source $VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH/bin/activate`
    - You should see `($VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH)` before your terminal output now.
3. Install the requirements
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Building the React App
1. Run `./build_react.sh`

### Running
Make sure you have a file called setenv.sh with all the specified environment variables in `project/__init__.py`  
1. Make sure you are in the virtual environment
    - You should see `($VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH)` before your terminal output.
2. `./run_server.sh` to start the server, and go to the URL the terminal output gives you.
    - Make sure this script is in executable mode.
3. If you want to build the React App and run, use `./build_and_run.sh`


### Testing
1. Make sure you are in the virtual environment
    - You should see `($VIRTUAL_ENV_PATH)` before your terminal output.
2. `./run_tests.sh`  


write all flask tests in tests.py  


### Leaving the virtual environment

`deactivate`

### Folders
- `config` - Flask configuration and Firebase Database rules
- `draft_html` - Rendered HTML documents of which pages are needed
- `project` - Entry for the Flask project (Website Engine)
- `suicide_chess_react` - Entry for the React project (Suicide Chess Game App)
- `uidraft` - screenshot drafts of the UI
